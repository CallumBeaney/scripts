Little tools and experiments. 

  <br>

- mkcd: `mkcd directoryName` → `*hacker voice* i'm in.`
- Age Calculator: `howold 01/01/1980` 
- Clipboard Wordcounter: `howlong` → reads from the clipboard directly and counts the length 
- daysBetweenChecker: `days 25/3/2023 27/5/2023` -> ` = 2 months, 3 days (63 days total)`
- To Monochrone: `bw` → for when I want no colours on my screen. Applescript is cancer and I absolutely recommend not trying to update this.
- News Checker: `news` → gets me headlines and clickable links via some APIs, sort of like RSS but for terminal.
- Give Up Checker
