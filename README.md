I generally dislike GUIs and most website interfaces and often find myself wondering why a site or app needed to be anything more than a 90s era textform or command line interface. The internet is overloaded with intrusive advertising, popups, viruses, immorality, and worst of all, javascript. These programs are little attempts to not have to deal with all of that.  Most of it's done in C, but I also really enjoy using Dart, which is roughly to Google what C# is to Java.
